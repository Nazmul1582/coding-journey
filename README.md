# 🧠 My Coding Journey

This repository tracks my daily progress in mastering C++ fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and backend development.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build strong logic and problem-solving skills.
- Master C++ as my main programming language.
- Learn Rust and backend development.
- Prepare for technical interviews and real-world projects.

## 🗓️ Daily Routine

1. Solve 5-7 problems daily.
2. Continue the coding fundamentals and logic building with dsa.
<!-- 3. Contribute to open-source or personal backend projects. -->

## 📈 Long-Term Plan

- Build strong DSA + backend foundation.
- Contribute to real backend projects using Node.js / Rust / Go.
- Become a Senior Backend Developer 🚀
